##### Findings:

Alstom is back in the project and has taken back the leadership of WP3.
The issue can be closed.  
The signature to the PCA is still open.

The change request is pending. No response received from ITEA yet. 

4. Deliverables and document approbation / revision of WP2 deliverables  
The proposal has been discussed in detail. Rules on who has to sign will be documented in the QA-plan.  
The signatures will be collected by project office. The paper copy will be kept in project office. The scanned document may be uploaded to Github if non of the participants rejects.  

The proposal is accepted without objections.  
5. The openETCS Charta  
It was discussed wether the charta has to be reviewd and confirmed by legals department. On this topic, no common understanding was possible.
Another proposal discussed was the declaration of the Charta as an output document of the openETCS Itea project following the openETCS development process.
Two votes were done to come to a decision. Both did not get majority.

* Vote to get the proposal to handle the charta as an openETCS document
* Vote to get the charta agreed.

The procedure on how to come to a Charta has been discussed without coming to a decision.
Conclusion: An official review will be started to manage the review of the Charta.  
The issue of the Charta will be resumed at the next PCC meeting.
